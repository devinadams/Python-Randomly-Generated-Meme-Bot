# Python-Randomly-Generated-Meme-Bot
Python randomly generated meme bot. Randomly generates memes from a source image and defined template.


The templates.rar file contains all the templates.

The dimensions and offset needed to place the source image is defined in templates.py

Each template much be defined to properly fit the source image. 

I have pre-configured 20 templates. Any source images will work.

Simply make an "out" folder, "templates" folder from the rar and a "source" folder containing your source images.

Requires Pillow(PIL)
